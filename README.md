# School-project

This is a repository where I will be storing all my programs which I write for practice in school or school homeworks. Anyone is allowed to view this, share, modify and suggest edits or better way to make the programs more logical and easy. Since this is just to store my school taught programs, it will be just simple programs.

P.S.- Sorry for the bad English.
